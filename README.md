Sensor Data Collection App is a modular Android application suite designed for research-based physiological data collection using a Wear OS watch and a paired mobile phone. The system comprises two Kotlin-based apps: a Wear OS watch app and a mobile phone app. The watch app collects Heart Rate sensor data and stores it in CSV files, which are synced to the phone via the Data Layer API. The phone app allows participants to manage their profile, configure settings, and control data collection. Features include configurable sensor sampling rates, modular sensor architecture for easy extension, clean separation of responsibilities across modules, and professional UI/UX design. Collected data is exported to the phone's external storage under Download/sensor_data. The implementation ensures proper permissions, configurable constants, and robust phone-watch communication for synchronized data collection and control.
